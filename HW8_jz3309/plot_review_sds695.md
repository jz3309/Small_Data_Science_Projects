## Clarity
Jingxi’s plot was clear and easy to interpret. It shows the regions of high accidents and regions of low accidents. The caption describes that the data was taken from the period of 2012-2018.

## Esthetic
The single colour scheme fits this data well as the objective is to identify spots of high or low accidents. The size of the plot is good as the plot is reasonably large to be able to identify small zipcode areas as well.

## Honesty
The data was downloaded reproducibly and the steps to clean and plot the data. The map values were not changed to show a certain point in the map.

## Recommendation
I would recommend investigating the population density in these areas as there may be more accidents in areas where a lot of people live. I would also recommend using bins to assign color rather than a continuous color scheme.
